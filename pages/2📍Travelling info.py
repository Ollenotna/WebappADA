    Do you sometimes realize on the amount of decisions you make every time you plan a new trip? From straightforward choices like selecting restaurants 
    and activities to more complex ones as considering the time of year, the country, the duration and list goes on. Here, we aimed to streamline this 
    decision making process for people that like BEER. We have characterized several countries around the globe in terms of proportion of industrial and 
    local breweries, along with the preferred beer styles during each trimester of the year. Furthermore, we've provided descriptions of beer styles by 
    keywords gathered among all the users in the platforms. Our goal with the following beerlogue is to facilitate the exploration of new beer styles and 
    simplify the decision-making process for your upcoming travels """)

    We started by surveying breweries in countries containing more than 30 breweries. aiming to delineate between those categorized as 
    industrial breweries and local breweries. The traditional beer terminology (nano, micro and macrobreweries) is linked to annual barrel production,
    rather to the variety of beers produced. In this study, we didn't have information about the anual barrel production for each brewery, therefore,
    we came up with a simpler clasification: breweries producing fewer than 15 beer varieties were classified as local, while those producing 15 or more 
    were categorized as industrial. """)

    Our thresholding for local versus industrial breweries pivots on the following factors. First, we consider the availability of beers outside their countries 
    of origin. Industrial breweries tipically reach a broader ranger of countries due to their scale of production. Breweries producing few beers can be 
    probably associated to low production. Secondly, this classification can offer insights about the countries' beer culture. Countries with a higher prevalence
    of local breweries might have a richer craft culture for travelers seeking authentic and diverse beer experiences.
